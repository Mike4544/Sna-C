# **The reason for starting this project**

    The main reason I started working on this project is to get more familiar with the C programming language, as well as get more comfortable with memory management (which I'm not sure I'm succeeding at, oh well) and, obviously (as seen from the implementation itself), linked-lists.

<br></br>

# **More features or is this the end?**

    Woah, just hold back a bit; the game is still as barebones as it gets. It doesn't even have a `Start` screen!

    However, I do have some plans for this! Stay tuned!

<br></br>

# **Current road-map**

* Basic functionality - ✔️
* Aesthetics - 50%
  * Sprites (_for lack of a better term_)- ✔️
  * Basic UI that encompases the instructions and score - ✔️
    * (Will update it at a later time)
  * Game Over screen - ❌
  * Main Menu screen - ❌
* Support for Linux - ❌
* Extra Modes - ❌
  * Single-player (_which doesn't count_)
  * **_Multiplayer????_** - ❌... _for now..._
  
  <br></br>

#   **How to install**

    * Download the repo on your machine
    * Run `build.bat`
    * Enjoy!

    ** Optional: Modify the `defines.h` values to your liking :)

_* Currently only Windows is supported_<br>
_** Linux support is coming soon_


# **Conclusions**

    Overall this has been and still is quite a nice project, that I'm 100% going to update. 

    If I were to pick a mechanic that proved to be more of a hassle than anything, probably the movement of the other snake parts.
    
    There surely are much better implementations out there, but I'm quite happy with the overall result :)
